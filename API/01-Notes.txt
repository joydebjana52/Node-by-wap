Whatever functionalities a server has can be handled in two ways:
a.) User Interface -> This is also known as monolithic.
    => After completing our tasks(like performing CRUD operations), we'll send the UI's code from the back-end, such as "<h1>email</h1>".
b.) Data.
    => Do not send the UI's code, only send data. This data will be displayed by front-end developers. This approach belongs to microservices.
    In microservices architecture, only data is exchanged. There are many ways to write code in microservices architecture, such as:~
    1.) Rest API
    2.) Indepedent service(pure microservice architecture is something, which has different different service like login,signup hoisted on
    different different servers).


a.) For Rest API, we'll create a single app(assume a node application) and defined everything in it.
b.) But in microservice architecture, we should keep all services(like login, signup) Indepedent.
==> In microservice architecture, we should keep all services (like login, signup) independent. For example,
suppose we've written programs for user data, product management, and password recovery differently and hosted them on
different servers. If they're still able to communicate(interconnected), then this will be called independent services or microservices.

**) 
a.) Microservices are better than REST API applications when it comes to server crashes. In microservices, there are many servers, if any one fails,
it will not affect the other servers. However, in a REST API, as we use a single server, then the entire REST API application will stop working.
b.) REST API is good for building small to medium applications, but microservices are better suited for building large applications.

*) Rate limiting in REST APIs refers to a technique used to control the number of requests that a client can make to an API within a given period of time.
It helps to prevent abuse or overuse of the API, ensuring fair usage for all consumers and maintaining the stability and performance of the API server.

When rate limiting is implemented, the API server will track the number of requests made by each client or API key within a certain timeframe, such as
per second, minute, or hour. If a client exceeds the predefined limit, the server may respond with an error code (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) indicating
that the client has reached its rate limit. This prevents the server from being overwhelmed by too many requests from a single client.

Rate limiting can be applied globally across all endpoints of an API or selectively on specific endpoints based on different criteria such as user roles,
API key, IP address, or subscription plan. It is an important mechanism for managing API usage, preventing abuse, and ensuring fair access for all consumers.

*) Generally, we don't develop REST APIs using core Node.js because it's not so convenient due to callback hell.
To overcome this, we use Node.js frameworks like Express, Fastify, NestJS, Koa. We'll learn Express.

*) In Rest API we don't send code for UIs, only send data in the form of Array of Object or Object.
*) In a REST API, we don't send code for UIs, we only send data in the form of arrays of objects or objects.
*) Three points to keep in mind, while developing a Rest API:~
    1.) Content-Type should be 'application/json' (response should be in JSON format).
    2.) Relevant status code.
    3.) Headers.

*) We'll use Express to build Rest APIs in convenient way.

Basic syntax of Express.JS:~
    const express = require('express');
    const server = express();
    server.listen(6000);

    server.get('/path', (req, res) => {
        //some code
        res.send();
    });


*) In the above code, '/path' is known as an 'endpoint', meaning that it follows the domain (when the app is hosted) or 
the port (when the app runs on a local machine). What we write after the domain or port is considered the endpoint.

*) In a REST API application, the 'endpoint' is very important. By reading the endpoint, we can determine the functionalities it provides.

*) For Rest API application, in which file/package we define functionalities, known as "Controller". For that we keep seprate folder Generally,
named "controller" and inside that folder, we write our logic files.

*) Code:~

    const express = require('express');
    const server = express();
    const {
        fetchTickets,
        createTicket,
        updateTicket,
        deleteTicket
    } = require('./controller/ticket.controller');

    server.listen(9000);

    server.get('/ticket', fetchTickets);
    server.post('/ticket', createTicket);
    server.put('/ticket', updateTicket);
    server.delete('/ticket', deleteTicket);

*) In the above code, the functions fetchTickets, createTicket, updateTicket, and deleteTicket all automatically receive the req and res parameters.

*) In the entry file (index.js), we first connect to the database(Very first line), which is a good practice.
This ensures that if the database connection is established properly, users can interact with the database.

*) For a schema(check the below one):~

    const mongoose = require('mongoose');

    const ticketSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
        title: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        description: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        status: {
            type: String,
            default: 'pending'
        },
        createdAt: {
            type: Date,
            default: Date.now
        }
    });

    const ticket = mongoose.model('Ticket', ticketSchema); //! "Ticket" is colleciton name
    module.exports = ticket;

a.) "default" is used to set a default value, as its name implies.
b.) "required" indicates whether that field is compulsory or optional.
c.) "type" specifies the data type that the field should contain.
